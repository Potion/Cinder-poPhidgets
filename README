This is the Phidgets CinderBlock, designed for use with the open-source C++ library Cinder: http://libcinder.org

Phidgets are a great line of products for USB Sensing and control. For simple input and output, they're an off-the-shelf
solution that precludes any time-consuming development of custom microcrontroller-based hardware.

Integrates Phidgets API v2.1.

So far it supports Analog input from the PhidgetInterfaceKit 8/8/8

I've been testing with the Touch Sensors, but it should work fine with other analog sensors in the Phidgets Universe
